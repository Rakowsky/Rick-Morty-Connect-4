#### Overview

Connect 4, a 2 player game where the first person to connect 4 chips in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

###### Constraints:

- Timing (I had family in town)
- Animation: I wish I could have included great CSS animation
- Cells dropping: Unable to have the last rows fill up first with Javascript, so instead the user 	clicks on the exact cell they want 
- Differentiating between player turns
- Clean up winner function

--- 
###### Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery

---
###### Approaches Taken:

- How will we create the board? Through a double for loop creating a board array 
- How do we declare a winner? Read through board to find for in a row, column, or diagonal 
- How will we toggle player turns? Through boolean true/false values

---

###### Unsolved Problems:
- Input form for player names
- Alert for player winner
- CSS change once winner declared
- New Game button

###### Final Thoughts:

Very excited by the game. Could fix some bugs and tweak the code, but overall it was a fun, challenging project.
